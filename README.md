# Sticky-Notes
I designed and built a Sticky Notes app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is built using  modern web development techniques such as event listeners, creating HTML elements dynamically,  and local storage. I implemented these techniques to provide users with a responsive, intuitive, and  dynamic user interface
